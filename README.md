NAME
----

osdev - A nameless x86 OS development project

DESCRIPTION
-----------

osdev is yet another attempt at creating a simple but functional x86 operating
system, for fun.

This project will consist of the following components:

- A two-stage bootloader with FAT32 support
- An operating system kernel that supports paged memory management, a
  virtual filesystem, and preemptive multitasking
- Some userspace utilities, if we ever get that far :)
